# Excercise Project - MyBookstore

MyBookstore is an excercise project for us to get more familiar with JavaScript framework, before we moved on to the next module.

The project simply used a free internal API with list of books and required us to create a website displaying the information for each book using JavaScript. Specific requirements are display of book information with flipping animation and carousel slides. Fomatting framework such as bootstraps was allowed.

The final design was deployed on Netlify under: https://junsbookstore.netlify.com/
